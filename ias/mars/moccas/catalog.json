  "description": "This catalog will include vector and raster datasets that are part of the \"Mars Orbital Catalog of\nAqueous Alteration Signatures\" (MOCAAS), global repository of secondary minerals formed through interaction with\nwater on Mars. This work is based on the analysis of orbital imaging spectroscopy data from the OMEGA/Mars Express\nand CRISM/MRO near-infrared instruments. A database and a set of high-resolution global maps (200 m/pix) are\nproduced which provide a large collection of these \"aqueous\" secondary mineral deposits, most of which were not\npreviously reported.\n",
