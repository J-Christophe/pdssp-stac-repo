This work is based on the\nanalysis of orbital imaging spectroscopy data from the OMEGA/Mars Express and CRISM/MRO near-infrared instruments.\nA database and a set of high-resolution global maps (200 m/pix) are produced which provide a large collection of\nthese \"aqueous\" secondary mineral deposits, most of which were not previously reported.\n",
